🎮 Advanced Moving Tic-Tac-Toe

 
📌 Description
Advanced Moving Tic-Tac-Toe is a modern, web-based strategy game that evolves the classic formula. Once players reach their piece limit, the game enters a Movement Phase, during which players slide pieces into adjacent or diagonal slots to win.

This project demonstrates a full DevOps Lifecycle, featuring a high-speed CI/CD pipeline managed via GitHub Actions and containerized with Docker for seamless deployment to Render.

✨ Features
Dynamic Board Scaling: Play on 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 grids.

Advanced Moving Mechanic: Once the piece limit is reached (e.g., 3 pieces for 3x3), players must move existing pieces to adjacent/diagonal empty cells.

Winning Celebrations: Integrated canvas-confetti for interactive feedback.

Modern UI/UX: Sleek Dark Mode toggle and responsive CSS design.

State Management: Includes an Undo system and Local Storage for player persistence.
